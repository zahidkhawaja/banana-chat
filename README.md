# Banana Chat UI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) chatbot template for open source LLMs deployed on Banana.

In this example, we are running [Dolly 2.0 12B](https://app.banana.dev/templates/bbreton3/dolly-2-12B/2) on Banana.

## Getting Started

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.

2. Create a `.env.local` file with `BANANA_API_KEY=your_api_key` and `BANANA_MODEL_KEY=your_model_key`.

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your project!

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/chat](http://localhost:3000/api/chat). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/chat.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
